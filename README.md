## Credits
PowerFox wouldn't be possible without the Basilisk and UXP teams for their incredible work on the underlying browser code, TenFourFox for various parts of legacy Mac OS X support code, and many UXP contributors who have worked on the Mac code, including but not limited to dbsoft and WolfReiser. Thank you!
